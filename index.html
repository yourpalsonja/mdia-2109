            <p>
                Before images, animation, and branding, the web was designed to
                share written knowledge, with typography as the interface.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Why Typography Matters</h2>

            <p>
                Good typography respects the reader, clarifies structure, and
                creates rhythm.
